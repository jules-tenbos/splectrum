# Simplified Git Workflow for AI Collaboration

**Target**: sesameh/claude-swift
**Date**: 2025-07-13
**From**: splectrum (architecture)

## Executive Summary

Remove branch/PR ceremony for AI-assisted development. Work directly on main branch with TDD and quality gates as the review mechanism.

## Rationale

In the "collaboration of minds" model:
- Traditional branches/PRs add friction without value
- TDD + quality gates provide automated verification
- Audit logs provide complete traceability
- AI and human can iterate rapidly without context switching

## Action Required

Update claude-swift to remove branch/PR ceremony for standard AI-assisted development workflows. Implement direct-to-main development with quality gates as the primary safety mechanism.

## Success Criteria / Quality Gates

- [ ] Branch creation removed from default workflow
- [ ] Direct commit/push to main implemented
- [ ] Quality gate checks remain mandatory before commit
- [ ] Branch support retained ONLY for experimental work (user must explicitly request)
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect new workflow
- [ ] Existing tests pass without modification
- [ ] Audit logging captures all git operations

## Implementation Notes

### 1. Direct-to-Main Development
```bash
# Default workflow becomes:
git add .
git commit -m "Clear description of change"
git push
```

### 2. Quality Gates Replace PR Reviews
- TDD ensures correctness BEFORE commit
- Automated tests run on push
- Failed tests trigger immediate fix
- No waiting for human review

### 3. When to Still Use Branches
- **Experimental work**: Explicitly requested by user
- **Multiple creators**: Working simultaneously  
- **Major changes**: Need human discussion
- **NOT for normal AI-assisted development**

### 4. Safety Mechanisms Remain
- **TDD-first**: Tests define success
- **Quality gates**: Automated verification
- **Audit logs**: Complete history
- **Error replay**: Debug any issues

## Benefits

1. **Faster iteration**: No branch management overhead
2. **Better AI context**: No switching between branches
3. **Immediate feedback**: Quality gates run instantly
4. **Simplified mental model**: Focus on creation, not git

## Implementation in claude-swift

1. Remove branch creation/switching logic for normal work
2. Keep branch support only for explicit experimental work
3. Emphasize TDD and quality gates in workflows
4. Trust the automated verification

## Migration Path

1. Start with new projects using direct-to-main
2. Migrate existing projects as comfortable
3. Keep PR workflow available for teams that prefer it
4. Let success demonstrate the value

## Event-Driven Integration

This aligns with event-driven choreography:
- Commit event → triggers quality gates
- Success event → triggers deployment
- Failure event → triggers fix workflow
- No blocking on human review events
