## SPlectrum Overview

**Create tools to enable P2P networks where distributed applications run in their own peer-to-peer environment, extending blockchain's decentralization philosophy to general-purpose computing.**

The SPlectrum ecosystem transforms distributed application development through five specialized organizations working together: execution engines (SPlectrum), solution composition (Carambah), packaging & deployment (InfoMetish), AI-driven intelligence (Sesameh), and P2P runtime compatibility (bare-for-pear). Each organization addresses specific concerns while enabling seamless collaboration through unified APIs and collaborative AI workflows.

Key innovations include event-driven choreography replacing rigid orchestration, unified app/module architecture enabling complexity navigation, and collaborative AI creation where humans evolve ideas while AI handles implementation labor.

## Organization Structure & Key Repositories

The SPlectrum ecosystem is organized around five specialized organizations, each addressing specific concerns:

### üöÄ **SPlectrum** - Execution Engine & Tool Integration
Core execution environment with DSL engine, unified API architecture, and streaming capabilities. Everything that exposes SPlectrum APIs lives here.

**Key Repository:** [https://github.com/SPlectrum/spl1](https://github.com/SPlectrum/spl1) - Primary execution engine implementation

### üì¶ **InfoMetish** - Packaging & Deployment  
Platform-specific packaging and deployment with container registry as authoritative source. Handles P2P packaging, container deployments, and traditional installations.

**Key Repository:** [https://github.com/InfoMetish/InfoMetis](https://github.com/InfoMetish/InfoMetis) - Container registry and deployment orchestration

### ü§ñ **Sesameh** - AI-Driven Behavioral Intelligence
Collaborative AI creation enabling human-AI partnership where humans define and AI implements. Quality gates, TDD workflows, and intelligent decision-making systems.

**Key Repository:** [https://github.com/Sesameh/claude-swift](https://github.com/Sesameh/claude-swift) - Collaborative AI development workflows

### üîß **Carambah** - Solution Composition
High-level solution assembly from simple component setups to complex vanilla solutions. Environment-agnostic compositions using vanilla dev configs.

**Key Repository:** [https://github.com/Carambah/carambah](https://github.com/Carambah/carambah) - Solution composition engine

### ‚ö° **bare-for-pear** - P2P Runtime Compatibility
JavaScript module conversions for Bare runtime (not Node.js), enabling true P2P networking capabilities through Pear platform integration.

**Status:** In development - foundational P2P networking modules

### How Organizations Work Together

```
SPlectrum (APIs & Engines) ‚Üí Carambah (Compositions) ‚Üí InfoMetish (Packaging) ‚Üí Deployment
                    ‚Üë                                           ‚Üë
              Sesameh (AI Intelligence)              bare-for-pear (P2P Runtime)
```

1. **SPlectrum** provides execution foundations and API wrappers
2. **Carambah** composes these into complete solutions  
3. **InfoMetish** packages compositions for target platforms
4. **Sesameh** adds intelligence at any layer
5. **bare-for-pear** enables P2P capabilities across the ecosystem
