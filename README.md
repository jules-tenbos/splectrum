# SPlectrum in a Nutshell

**SPlectrum is an application development platform designed to make creating applications accessible through natural human-AI collaboration, built on a foundation of open architecture, well-documented APIs, and comprehensive quality frameworks.**

This overview is structured in four parts: the foundations, the platform logical components, the application focus domains, and the ecosystem organization. For detailed implementation status, see [Functional Components](./docs/implementation/functional-components.md).

## SPlectrum Foundational Components

The foundational layer provides the core infrastructure that enables the **strict boundaries, internal freedom** design philosophy throughout the platform. These components create the technical foundations for boundary enforcement (AVRO schemas, validation) and internal flexibility (JavaScript dynamic typing, JIT adaptability, streaming patterns).

*Core infrastructure layers that other components depend on*

| **Peer to Peer** | Bare Runtime | ‚ùå Missing | Minimal runtime, ideal for P2P applications |
| | Pear Stack | ‚ùå Missing | Bare based P2P runtime with true P2P capabilities |

## SPlectrum Platform Logical Components

*Design approaches and methodologies that shape how the platform is built*

The platform applies a **strict boundaries, internal freedom** design philosophy enabled by the foundational architecture. **Strict boundaries** (AVRO validation, TDD contracts, schema enforcement) create **safe internal environments** with minimal constraints. Using this pattern single concern APIs are created that scale from **core APIs** at the fundamental level to **higher-level context APIs** while maintaining the same principle - each component has well-defined boundaries coupled with implementation freedom within those boundaries. This **DSL engine freedom of expression** approach is seen as an important stepping stone to meaningful AI autonomy.

|-----------------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| **API First-Class Citizen** | Item Help | ‚úÖ Exists | Current help system operational, needs AVRO schema integration |
| | API Discovery | ‚ùå Missing | Global `-h` flag with modules/apps list, API browsing capabilities |

| **Collaborative AI** | Human-AI Creative Partnership | ‚úÖ Exists | Shared context, human-in-the-loop design principles |
| | Shared Ways of Working | ‚úÖ Exists | Shared workflows and issue type defined workflows |
| | Strict Workflow Creation | ‚úÖ Exists | Workflows transferable to event driven choreography |
| **Event Driven Choreography** | Strict Workflow Execution | üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap | Automated execution of defined workflow patterns **(deterministic, no AI required)** |
| | AI Issue Resolution | üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap | Autonomous issue handling and resolution **(AI within strict test/validation boundaries)** |

## SPlectrum Application Focus

*Real-world application domains enabled by the platform capabilities*

| Domain | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Private P2P Networks** | Family and private group applications where trust is inherent and privacy is paramount. Home automation systems that operate without external servers, shared photo libraries within families, private communications, and collaborative tools for small trusted groups. These networks prioritize privacy, control, and independence from external infrastructure. |
| **Public P2P Networks** | Mass participation applications designed for open communities while maintaining decentralized infrastructure. Blockchain-integrated solutions, community platforms, content sharing networks, and collaborative applications that benefit from distributed participation without central control points. |
| **Business P2P Networks** | Enterprise applications that create ringfenced networks for specific employee groups or business functions. Department-specific tools, project collaboration networks, and business applications that maintain organizational boundaries while eliminating central server dependencies and reducing infrastructure costs. |
