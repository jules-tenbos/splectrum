# SPlectrum Capabilities Assessment - Brain Dump

*This document captures the current state of SPlectrum capabilities as we work toward MVP. This is an unstructured brain dump that will evolve into a structured capability matrix.*

## Purpose

This assessment identifies what exists today, what needs enhancement, and what's missing to reach MVP - the point where SPlectrum can be used to create applications and where P2P exploration can begin.

## Current Capabilities Assessment

### APIs as First-Class Citizens

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ **Help system in place** - We have a help system operational but it requires further development
- üîß **Structure overview enhancement needed** - The help system exists but lacks comprehensive structure overview capabilities that would make APIs truly discoverable and well-documented

**Notes:** The foundation is there but we need to enhance the structural aspects to make APIs genuinely first-class citizens with comprehensive documentation and discovery mechanisms.

### Schema Foundation

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ **API input schema** - Input schema system is implemented and functional
- ‚ùå **API output schema** - Output schema definition and validation is missing
- ‚ùå **RPC protocol schemas** - No formal schema definitions for RPC protocol communications
- ‚ùå **Data repository schemas** - Missing schema coverage for data persistence, particularly modules folder structure and other data storage patterns

**Notes:** We have partial schema coverage but need to complete the full schema ecosystem including output validation, RPC protocols, and data repository structures. This is critical for moving to AVRO-driven architecture.

### Dual-Mode API Access

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ **Scripting exists** - Current scripting system is functional
- ‚ùå **Programmatic continuation syntax** - The fluent, programmatic continuation syntax for natural expression is not yet implemented

**Notes:** We have one mode (scripting) but are missing the programmatic mode that would enable natural, flowing composition of operations through continuation syntax.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ **Initial testing API** - Basic testing API framework is in place
- ‚úÖ **Decent coding standards coverage** - Coding standards are established and reasonably covered
- ‚úÖ **Proof of concept functional testing** - Functional testing concepts have been proven and basic implementation exists

**Notes:** TDD foundation is relatively strong compared to other areas. The testing infrastructure provides a solid base for quality-driven development.

### Runtime Migration

**Current State:**
- ‚ùå **Migration to Bare** - No migration path or implementation for Bare runtime
- ‚ùå **Pear platform compatibility** - No compatibility layer or integration with Pear P2P stack

**Notes:** This is a complete gap that's essential for P2P capabilities. The migration from JavaScript to Bare runtime is critical for enabling true peer-to-peer networking through the Pear platform.

### UI Components

**Current State:**
- ‚ùå **Terminal UI components** - Question remains whether terminal UI components are necessary for MVP
- ‚ùå **Browser UI components** - Browser UI components require proof of concept development
- ‚ùå **Mobile compatibility** - No mobile compatibility implementation
- ‚ùå **PWA capabilities** - Progressive Web App capabilities not implemented

**Notes:** UI component support is largely missing. Need to determine priority and scope, particularly whether terminal UI is necessary, and develop proof of concept for browser-based components with mobile/PWA extension.

### Collaborative AI

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ **General workflows** - General AI collaboration workflows already exist in the claude-swift repository
- ‚ùå **Repo app with SPL APIs + DSL for git actions** - No repository management app using SPL APIs with appropriate DSL for git operations
- ‚ùå **Issue management DSL APIs** - Missing DSL API layer for issue management operations
- ‚ùå **Inbox/outbox pattern DSL APIs** - No DSL API implementation for cross-repository task management
- ‚úÖ **SPL instance for coding/implementation** - We already use an SPL instance for development work
- ‚ùå **DSL APIs for SPL instance** - The SPL instance lacks proper DSL API layer
- ‚ùå **Replace Claude Code tooling with SPL APIs** - Goal is to have all tooling available through SPL APIs rather than relying on Claude Code tooling and MCP
- ‚ùå **Replace MCP with SPL APIs** - Move away from MCP dependency to native SPL API implementations
- üîß **claude-swift as general wow component needs final cleanup** - claude-swift setup as a general ways of working component requires final cleanup to be MVP ready
- üîß **Issue management needs more structure** - Issue management system needs enhancement to create specific issue types with clear instructions on how to deal with different issue categories
- ‚ùå **Task engine for inbox/outbox with target execution + instructions** - Inbox/outbox pattern should function as a task engine that includes target specification (where tasks need to be executed) and moves 'things to do + how to do instructions' across repositories

**Notes:** Collaborative AI has some strong foundations (existing workflows, working SPL instance) but needs significant API layer development to achieve the vision of SPL-native tooling. The inbox/outbox task engine concept is particularly important for cross-repository coordination.

### AI Autonomy & Event-Driven Choreography

**Current State:**
- üîß **AI autonomy framework** - Closely associated with claude-swift development, but autonomous operation capabilities need implementation
- ‚ùå **Event-driven choreography system** - No autonomous event response system implemented
- ‚ùå **Autonomous task execution** - AI cannot independently execute tasks based on triggers
- ‚ùå **Self-validating operations** - Missing autonomous validation and quality gates
- ‚ùå **Autonomous workflow progression** - AI cannot progress through workflows without human intervention
- ‚ùå **Event triggers and responses** - No system for AI to respond autonomously to repository events, issues, or other triggers
- ‚ùå **Proof of concept autonomy** - Would be valuable to have some POC autonomous operations running in MVP

**Notes:** AI autonomy represents the progression from collaborative AI to independent AI operation within quality-assured boundaries. This is closely tied to the inbox/outbox pattern and event-driven choreography concepts. Having some proof of concept autonomy operational in MVP would demonstrate the platform's progression toward AI operational independence. The event-driven choreography system would enable AI to respond to conditions automatically without human orchestration.

### Ways of Working - Repository Organization

**Current State:**
- üîß **Overall repository structure organization** - Some understanding exists of how repositories should be organized, but the specific structure is still in flux and needs solidification
- üîß **API first-class citizen repositories structure** - Understanding needed of where and how we deal with API first-class citizen repositories within the SPlectrum organization structure
- üîß **Component/application/solution creation structure** - Carambah organization needs clearer structure for how we create components, applications, and solutions from SPlectrum APIs and third-party services
- üîß **Packaging structure** - InfoMetish organization needs defined structure for how we package and distribute solutions

**Notes:** This represents organizational and structural challenges rather than technical implementation gaps. The ways of working around repository organization, component creation, and packaging need to be formalized to support consistent development practices across the ecosystem.

## Important Distinction: Component vs Functional Capabilities

**Key Insight:** MVP should be about SPlectrum using its own capabilities to power its initial platform functions as proof of concepts.

**Two Types of Capabilities:**

1. **Component Capabilities** - The building blocks/infrastructure documented above
   - APIs, schemas, TDD framework, UI components, runtime migration, etc.
   - The "what can be built with" capabilities
   - Foundation components that enable development

2. **Functional Capabilities** - Actually running applications/POCs using those components  
   - SPlectrum using its own APIs for repository management
   - SPlectrum using its own DSL for issue management
   - SPlectrum using its own event system for autonomous operations
   - SPlectrum using its own UI components for interface
   - The "what is actually running" capabilities

**MVP Definition:** SPlectrum eating its own dog food - demonstrating platform capabilities by using them to power its own operations.

**Advisory Notes:**
- We may need to restructure this assessment to distinguish between component readiness and functional implementation
- Consider adding a "Functional POC Status" section showing what's actually running using SPlectrum components
- MVP milestone should measure both component availability AND functional demonstration
- Priority should focus on components that enable the most impactful functional POCs
- Success criteria should include "SPlectrum platform powered by SPlectrum capabilities"

## Next Steps

This brain dump will be refined into:
1. **Structured capability matrix** with clear categorization (component vs functional)
2. **Priority assessment** based on MVP requirements (functional POC impact)
3. **Dependency mapping** showing what blocks what (component ‚Üí functional dependencies)
4. **Implementation roadmap** toward MVP completion (SPlectrum self-powered milestone)
5. **Functional POC tracking** showing actual running demonstrations
