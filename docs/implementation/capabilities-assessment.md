# SPlectrum in a Nutshell

This overview is structured in four parts: the foundations, the platform components, the functional achievements of the MVP, and the roadmap.

## SPlectrum Foundational Components

The foundational layer provides the core infrastructure that enables the **strict boundaries, internal freedom** design philosophy throughout the platform. These components create the technical foundations for boundary enforcement (AVRO schemas, validation) and internal flexibility (JavaScript dynamic typing, JIT adaptability, streaming patterns).

*Core infrastructure layers that other components depend on*

| Area | Component | Current Status | Comments |
|------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| **JavaScript** | Node.js Runtime | ‚úÖ Exists | Server-side JavaScript with JIT compilation and event loop concurrency |
| | Browser Runtime | ‚úÖ Exists | Client-side JavaScript enabling unified development across contexts |
| | JIT Adaptability | ‚úÖ Exists | Dynamic API generation and runtime modification capabilities |
| | Data Interoperability | ‚úÖ Exists | Natural JS Object ‚Üî JSON ‚Üî AVRO transformation |

| | Validation | ‚ùå Missing | Input/output validation across platform |
| | Documentation | ‚ùå Missing | Auto-generated docs from schemas |
| | RPC | ‚ùå Missing | AVRO RPC setup for cross-service communication |
| **Streaming Native** | Kafka Record Format | ‚úÖ Exists | Internal data structure implementation |
| | Data Change Streaming | üîß Partial | Emit change records from repositories |
| **Functional Execution** | Nested Execution Pipeline | ‚úÖ Exists | Functional steps between, procedural within steps |
| | Stateless Execution Engine | ‚úÖ Exists | Engine requires no persistent state |
| **Peer to Peer** | Bare Migration | ‚ùå Missing | Bare compatibility layer development |
| | Pear Integration | ‚ùå Missing | True P2P capabilities (depends on Bare migration) |

## SPlectrum Platform Components

*Higher-level capabilities built on foundational components*

The platform applies a **strict boundaries, internal freedom** design philosophy enabled by the foundational architecture. **Strict boundaries** (AVRO validation, TDD contracts, schema enforcement) create **safe internal environments** with minimal constraints, enabling rapid development and AI autonomy. This pattern scales from **single concern APIs** at the fundamental level to **higher-level contexts** while maintaining the same principle - each component has well-defined boundaries but complete implementation freedom within those boundaries. The **DSL engine** exemplifies this approach: strict API contracts with flexible domain expression internally.

## SPlectrum Functional Achievements

*What SPlectrum can actually demonstrate using its own platform capabilities*

### Currently Working
- **SPL Development Instance** - We use SPlectrum for our own development work
- **Basic API Operations** - Item help and scripting functionality operational
- **AI-Assisted Workflows** - claude-swift provides working AI collaboration patterns
- **Testing Framework** - TDD practices and testing APIs in active use
- **Input Validation** - Schema-based input validation working

### MVP Functional Targets
- **SPL-Powered Repository Management** - Git operations via SPL APIs instead of external tools
- **SPL-Powered Issue Management** - Issue handling through SPlectrum DSL
- **Cross-Repository Task Coordination** - Inbox/outbox pattern working across repositories
- **Self-Documenting API System** - Structure overview generating live API documentation
- **Autonomous Task Processing** - Event-driven execution of routine operations
- **Quality-Assured Development** - All development using SPL testing and validation APIs

### Key Insight
**MVP Success Criteria**: SPlectrum development and operations powered entirely by SPlectrum APIs rather than external tooling (Claude Code, MCP, manual git operations, etc.)

## Post-MVP Roadmap

*Advanced capabilities deferred beyond MVP scope*
