# RELEASE_PROCESS Sub-Workflow

**Note:** This is a sub-workflow called by the main VERSION workflow router.

**Trigger**: Called via VERSION workflow router

## Overview

Complete release process for version closure including log archiving, historical preservation, and release artifact creation.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Pre-Release Validation
- Verify all Phase 1 planning issues closed
- Confirm all current version work completed
- Validate repository clean state

### 2. Audit Log Archiving Phase
```bash
# Create version archive directory
mkdir -p audit/v{VERSION}

# Move current audit logs to version archive
mv audit/current/* audit/v{VERSION}/

# Concatenate all session files into single version audit log
cat audit/v{VERSION}/*.log > audit/v{VERSION}/audit_v{VERSION}.log
rm audit/v{VERSION}/*_session*.log

# Ensure current directory is clean for next version
# (VERSION_TRANSITION workflow will process the archived audit data)
```

### 3. Commit & Integration Phase
```bash
# Commit archiving changes
git add audit/
git commit -m "Archive v{VERSION} audit logs and prepare for release

- Move audit/current/* to audit/v{VERSION}/
- Concatenate session logs into audit_v{VERSION}.log
- Preserve complete development audit trail

# Create and merge PR
gh pr create --title "Archive v{VERSION} logs and prepare for release"
gh pr merge --squash
```

### 4. Release Artifact Creation
```bash
# Read project configuration
source claude/project/version-config.md
source claude/project/project-info.md

# Execute project-specific build commands
for cmd in "${BUILD_COMMANDS[@]}"; do
    echo "Executing: $cmd"
    eval $cmd
done

# Execute project-specific test commands  
for cmd in "${TEST_COMMANDS[@]}"; do
    echo "Testing: $cmd"
    eval $cmd
done

# Create release artifacts
for cmd in "${ARTIFACT_COMMANDS[@]}"; do
    echo "Creating artifact: $cmd"
    eval $cmd
done
```

### 5. GitHub Release Creation
```bash
# Create version tag
git tag v{VERSION}
git push origin v{VERSION}

# Create GitHub release with version achievements as release notes
gh release create v{VERSION} --title "{PROJECT_NAME} v{VERSION}" --notes-file audit/v{VERSION}/learning_v{VERSION}.log {ARTIFACT_NAME}.7z
```

## Release Workflow Execution

### Mandatory Workflow Logging
```

##→YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ | RELEASE_PROCESS | step_description: archive logs with version stamps
##→YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ | RELEASE_PROCESS | step_description: reset logs for next version
##→YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ | RELEASE_PROCESS | step_description: commit and merge archiving changes
##→YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ | RELEASE_PROCESS | step_description: create release artifacts and test installation
##→YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ | RELEASE_PROCESS | step_description: create version tag and GitHub release
##→YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ | RELEASE_PROCESS | workflow_complete: v{VERSION} release created successfully
```

## Version Strategy
**Loaded from Project Hooks:**
- Version strategy and numbering patterns defined in `claude/project/hooks/version-config.md`
- Project-specific release criteria and artifact configuration
- Development phases and milestone structure

## Integration Points

### Version Management
- Follows Critical Version Management Rule from CLAUDE.md
- Maintains complete historical tracking through archived logs
- Clean separation between version development cycles

### Development Continuity  
- Archived logs preserve complete development history
- Fresh logs enable clean start for next version
- Historical learnings remain accessible for future reference

### Release Artifacts
- Git tags for version identification
- GitHub releases with comprehensive release notes from learnings
- Self-extracting archive for distribution

## Benefits

### Historical Preservation
- Complete development history maintained in archived logs
- Learning documentation preserved for future reference  
- Decision context available for retrospective analysis

### Clean Version Transitions
- Fresh start for next version development
- Clear separation between version cycles
- Systematic release preparation process

### Release Accountability
- Comprehensive release notes from captured learnings
- Complete traceability from planning through implementation
- Systematic version closure process

## Release Execution Lessons (v0.6.1 Experience)

### First Release Insights
Based on the first "release sesame" execution for v0.6.1, the following refinements and patterns have been identified:

#### **Planning vs Implementation Releases**
- **Planning Releases** (like v0.6.1): Focus on architectural documentation, no binary artifacts
- **Implementation Releases**: Include tested binary artifacts and deployment packages
- **Release Type** should be determined during release planning phase

#### **Release Notes Generation Pattern**
```markdown
# Release Notes Template

```

#### **Project Management Integration**
- **GitHub Project Cleanup**: Projects should be archived/deleted after release to maintain focus
- **Issue Migration**: Implementation issues created during planning belong to next version
- **Milestone Closure**: All Phase milestones should be completed before version release
- **Historical Record**: Release notes serve as permanent record when projects are cleaned

### Artifact Strategy by Release Type

#### **Planning Releases**
- **Documentation Focus**: Comprehensive architecture and planning documentation
- **No Binary Artifacts**: Skip self-extract creation and installation packages
- **Historical Preservation**: Emphasis on complete development history archiving
- **Strategic Record**: Detailed achievement summaries for lasting reference

#### **Implementation Releases**
- **Binary Artifacts**: Include tested SPlectrum.exe, SPlectrum.7z packages
- **Installation Documentation**: Updated INSTALL.md and deployment guides
- **Testing Validation**: Include release testing results and validation reports
- **User-Focused**: Emphasis on feature delivery and usability improvements

### Version Strategy Guidelines

#### **Version Numbering Strategy**
- **Major.Minor.Patch** format (e.g., 0.6.1)
- **Planning Phases**: Increment minor version (0.6.0 → 0.6.1)
- **Implementation Phases**: Increment patch version (0.6.1 → 0.6.2)
- **Major Features**: Increment minor version (0.6.x → 0.7.0)
- **Breaking Changes**: Increment major version (0.x.x → 1.0.0, 1.x.x → 2.0.0)

#### **Release Criteria**
**Planning Release Criteria:**
- All Phase 1 planning issues completed across target epics
- Comprehensive architectural documentation created
- Implementation roadmap established with clear next steps
- Development infrastructure improvements documented

**Implementation Release Criteria:**
- Core functionality implemented and tested
- Binary artifacts validated through testing workflow
- Documentation updated to reflect implementation changes
- User-facing improvements ready for deployment

#### **Release Timing Strategy**
- **Natural Completion Points**: Release when meaningful work units are complete
- **Planning Completion**: When architectural foundations are established
- **Implementation Milestones**: When significant functionality is working and tested
- **Avoid Arbitrary Timing**: Release based on work completion, not calendar schedule
