# VERSION_TRANSITION Sub-Workflow

**Note:** This is a sub-workflow called by the main VERSION workflow router.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY VERSION TRANSITION ⚠️

**MANDATORY VERSION TRANSITION**: After any version release completion, Claude MUST execute this systematic transition workflow to process development knowledge and prepare for next version.

**Trigger**: Called via VERSION workflow router

**Input**: Closed version audit logs in `claude/audit/v{version}/`
**Output**: Updated knowledge base, onboarding documentation, and clean next version preparation

## MANDATORY TRANSITION SEQUENCE:

### 1. Audit Log Analysis and Processing
- **Process Version Audit Data**: Analyze all files in `claude/audit/v{version}/` for systematic knowledge extraction
- **Extract Knowledge Domains**: Generate frequency analysis of knowledge domains touched during version

## Audit Log Processing Methodology

### Knowledge Domain Analysis
```bash
# Extract all knowledge domains from version audit logs
grep -o 'domains:\[[^]]*\]' claude/audit/v{version}/*.log | 
cut -d'[' -f2 | cut -d']' -f1 | 
tr ',' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

### Component Interaction Mapping
```bash
# Extract file interaction patterns
grep -o 'files:\[[^]]*\]' claude/audit/v{version}/*.log |
cut -d'[' -f2 | cut -d']' -f1 |
tr ',' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

### Development Pattern Recognition
- **Workflow Frequency**: Identify most common workflow types and execution patterns
- **Time Distribution**: Analyze time spent across different knowledge domains
- **Component Hotspots**: Identify files and areas with highest modification frequency
- **Cross-Domain Activities**: Map activities that span multiple knowledge domains

## Documentation Update Strategy

### Current Platform Documentation (Steps 2-3)
**Target Folders**: `docs/guides/`, `docs/specifications/` (current platform state)
1. **Development Guides**: Enhance with practical insights from version development
2. **System Specifications**: Update with actual implementation patterns and current architecture
3. **Process Documentation**: Refresh with proven workflow effectiveness and process improvements
4. **File References**: Ensure all current platform documentation references are accurate

### Knowledge Base Documentation (Step 5)
**Output**: `docs/knowledge-base/` (comprehensive technical reference)
1. **Component Interaction Guides**: Data-driven guides based on actual co-modification patterns
2. **Workflow Effectiveness**: Document proven patterns and process improvements from strategic analysis
3. **Architecture Evolution**: Capture architectural insights and design patterns discovered
4. **Development Best Practices**: Formalize successful development approaches and techniques

### Get Started Documentation (Step 6)  
**Output**: `docs/get-started/` (onboarding-focused)
1. **Prerequisites Analysis**: Real requirements based on actual development experience
2. **Quickstart Guides**: Streamlined onboarding for new team members
3. **Essential Workflows**: Core processes needed for effective contribution
4. **Common Pitfalls**: Challenges and solutions from version development

### Preserved Documentation (No Updates)
**Excluded Folders**: `docs/architecture/`, `docs/integration/`, `docs/management/`, `docs/workflows/`, `docs/reference/`
- Contains design patterns, integration examples, governance documents, methodology illustrations
- Historical version markers and example versions remain unchanged
- Architectural timelessness preserved

### Stale Content Identification
1. **Outdated References**: Remove references to changed file locations or obsolete approaches
2. **Superseded Documentation**: Identify documentation replaced by better or more current versions
3. **Experimental Content**: Archive proof-of-concept documentation that's no longer relevant
4. **Broken Links**: Fix or remove documentation links that no longer point to valid content

## Version Metrics Generation

### Development Activity Metrics

- **Time Distribution**: Total development time and average session duration
- **Workflow Frequency**: Most common workflows and execution patterns
- **Work Type Categorization**: Development, operational, documentation, discussion, planning, testing
- **Planned vs Unplanned**: Ratio analysis of planned vs unplanned work
- **Component Activity**: Frequency of modification by file/component
