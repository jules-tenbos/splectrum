# Create Sesameh/claude-swift Repository One-Pager

## Description
Create a one-page overview document for the Sesameh/claude-swift repository in the org-repo/Sesameh/ folder. This is the AI workflow operations repository providing the "wow" (ways of working) framework.

Document should include: repository purpose for AI workflows, relationship to this splectrum repository (wow symlink), current features, and role in collaborative AI development.

## Priority: MEDIUM
**Justification:** Core AI workflow repository - provides operational foundation for this documentation project

## Dependencies
**Blocks:** None
**Blocked by:** Org-repo folder structure creation
**Related:** SE requirements for claude-swift (from spl1 work plan)

## Effort: S
**Estimate:** Small effort - single repository overview document

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] Created org-repo/Sesameh/claude-swift.md one-pager
- [ ] Explains "fast-turnover operational workflows for Claude Code"
- [ ] Documents key workflow systems (SESSION_START, INBOX, COMMIT, etc.)
- [ ] Notes relationship to splectrum repository (claude/wow symlink)
- [ ] Describes collaborative AI development approach
- [ ] Links to Sesameh organization mission (AI-driven intelligence)
- [ ] Consistent format with other repository one-pagers

## Work Area: org-repo-structure
**Context:** AI workflow operations repository providing operational framework for collaborative development
