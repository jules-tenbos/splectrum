# Create bare-for-pear/avsc Repository One-Pager

## Description
Create a one-page overview document for the bare-for-pear/avsc repository in the org-repo/bare-for-pear/ folder. This is the Avro for JavaScript library adapted for Bare runtime.

Document should include: repository purpose for AVRO schema handling, critical role in SPlectrum's AVRO-based architecture, conversion from Node.js to Bare runtime, and importance for P2P schema validation.

## Priority: HIGH
**Justification:** Critical library for SPlectrum's AVRO-based architecture - essential for schema validation in P2P environments

## Dependencies
**Blocks:** None
**Blocked by:** Org-repo folder structure creation
**Related:** SPlectrum AVRO architecture, bare-for-pear conversion mission

## Effort: S
**Estimate:** Small effort - single repository overview document

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] Created org-repo/bare-for-pear/avsc.md one-pager
- [ ] Explains AVRO for JavaScript library purpose
- [ ] Documents critical role in SPlectrum's AVRO-based foundation
- [ ] Notes Bare runtime conversion importance
- [ ] Describes P2P schema validation capabilities
- [ ] Links to SPlectrum technical foundation
- [ ] Consistent format with other repository one-pagers

## Work Area: org-repo-structure
**Context:** Critical AVRO library converted for Bare runtime - foundation for SPlectrum P2P schema validation
