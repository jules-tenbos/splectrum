# Create Initial Org-Repo Folder Structure

## Description
Create the basic org-repo/ directory structure with organization folders and README templates. This establishes the foundation for one-page overviews of organizations and repositories, with the actual content to be added in subsequent tasks.

Create folder structure: org-repo/[organization-name]/ with placeholder README.md files for each of the 5 SPlectrum organizations.

## Priority: MEDIUM
**Justification:** Foundation task that enables subsequent organization and repository documentation tasks

## Dependencies
**Blocks:** Individual org/repo documentation tasks
**Blocked by:** None
**Related:** Organization documentation tasks (issues #3-#7)

## Effort: S
**Estimate:** Small effort - just directory creation and template setup

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] Created org-repo/ directory in project root
- [ ] Created subdirectories for each organization (SPlectrum, InfoMetish, Sesameh, Carambah, bare-for-pear)
- [ ] Added placeholder README.md with consistent template in each org folder
- [ ] Template includes sections for organization overview and repository list
- [ ] Structure ready for content population in follow-up tasks

## Work Area: documentation-structure
**Context:** Initial atomic task for org-repo structure. Follow-up tasks will populate content for each organization and key repositories.
