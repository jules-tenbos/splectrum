# Create SPlectrum/spl1 Repository One-Pager

## Description
Create a one-page overview document for the SPlectrum/spl1 repository in the org-repo/SPlectrum/ folder. This is the primary execution engine repository and most important in the SPlectrum ecosystem.

Document should include: repository purpose, current status, key features, relationship to other repositories (spl0, extraction targets), and role in the seed-to-split transition strategy.

## Priority: MEDIUM
**Justification:** Core repository of the ecosystem - essential for understanding SPlectrum's current state and future direction

## Dependencies
**Blocks:** None
**Blocked by:** Org-repo folder structure creation
**Related:** Other repository one-pager tasks

## Effort: S
**Estimate:** Small effort - single repository overview document

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] Created org-repo/SPlectrum/spl1.md one-pager
- [ ] Includes repository purpose and description
- [ ] Documents current development status
- [ ] Lists key features and capabilities
- [ ] Explains relationship to spl0 and evolution path
- [ ] Notes planned extraction strategy (carambah/spl-dev, app repos)
- [ ] Consistent format with other repository one-pagers

## Work Area: org-repo-structure
**Context:** Primary execution engine repository - the seed repo that will split into distributed components
