# Create SPlectrum/hello-splectrum Repository One-Pager (Archived)

## Description
Create a one-page overview document for the archived SPlectrum/hello-splectrum repository in the org-repo/SPlectrum/ folder. This was the initial exploration repository in the bootstrapping journey.

Document should include: historical purpose, role in Phase 1 proof of concept, why it was archived, and its place in the evolution chain leading to spl0 and spl1.

## Priority: LOW
**Justification:** Archived repository - valuable for historical context and understanding evolution

## Dependencies
**Blocks:** None
**Blocked by:** Org-repo folder structure creation
**Related:** spl0, spl1 repository one-pagers (evolution chain)

## Effort: S
**Estimate:** Small effort - single archived repository overview document

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] Created org-repo/SPlectrum/hello-splectrum.md one-pager
- [ ] Explains initial exploration purpose "process flow and runtime"
- [ ] Documents role in Phase 1 proof of concept
- [ ] Notes archival status and reasons
- [ ] Describes position in evolution: hello-splectrum â†’ spl0 â†’ spl1
- [ ] Historical context for SPlectrum development journey
- [ ] Consistent format with other repository one-pagers

## Work Area: org-repo-structure
**Context:** Archived initial exploration repository - foundation of SPlectrum evolution
