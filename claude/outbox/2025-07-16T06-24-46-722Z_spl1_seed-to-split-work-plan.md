# Create Work Plan for Seed-to-Split Transition: SPlectrum/SPL1 to Multi-Repo Architecture

## Description
Based on the existing documentation in splectrum/splectrum, create a comprehensive work plan to transition spl1 from its current seed repository state to a split multi-repository architecture. The plan should achieve: 1) A SPlectrum engine split-off that becomes carambah/spl-dev sufficient to drive development tasks, 2) Initial batch of app repositories under splectrum/[app]_[api] structure, 3) An SE (Software Environment) for claude-swift development. The work plan should reference and build upon the existing bootstrapping documentation in docs/implementation/bootstrapping/splectrum-evolution.md and align with the architectural patterns documented in the docs/ structure.

## Priority: HIGH
**Justification:** Critical for ecosystem evolution - enables the transition from centralized seed development to distributed single-concern repositories, unlocking parallel development across organizations

## Dependencies
**Blocks:** None
**Blocked by:** v0.1.0 documentation completion (issues #2-#10)
**Related:** Architecture pattern documentation (issues #8, #9, #10)

## Effort: L
**Estimate:** Comprehensive work plan covering architecture extraction, repository setup, testing infrastructure, and migration coordination across multiple organizations

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] Complete analysis of existing spl1 architecture and identify extraction boundaries
- [ ] Create detailed technical specification for SPlectrum engine extraction to carambah/spl-dev
- [ ] Design repository structure for initial app batch under splectrum/ organization
- [ ] Specify SE requirements and setup for claude-swift development environment
- [ ] Define migration timeline with clear phases and deliverables
- [ ] Document testing strategy to validate extracted components
- [ ] Create coordination plan between SPlectrum, Carambah, and Sesameh organizations
- [ ] Establish success criteria and rollback procedures for the transition

## Work Area: spl1-evolution
**Context:** Work plan builds on documented seed-to-split lifecycle from CCAI evolutionary paradigm and existing bootstrapping strategy. This task implements the architectural vision of moving from interactive exploration (seed repos) to event-driven automation (single-concern repos), enabling the natural scaling pattern described in the documentation.
