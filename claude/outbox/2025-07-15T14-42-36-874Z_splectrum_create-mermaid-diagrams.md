# Create Mermaid Overview Diagrams for Repository Evolution and Mature Structure

## Description
Create comprehensive Mermaid diagrams to visualize the SPlectrum project architecture evolution from seed repositories to mature organizational structure. This includes both the evolutionary path (hello-splectrum â†’ spl0 â†’ spl1 â†’ component extraction) and the final mature structure showing the relationship between SPlectrum, InfoMetish, Carambah, and Sesameh organizations.

## Priority: HIGH
**Justification:** Critical for architectural documentation and understanding the bootstrapping strategy. These diagrams will serve as key reference materials for the project evolution and final organizational structure.

## Dependencies
**Blocks:** Future architecture documentation tasks
**Blocked by:** Recent architecture insights and documentation completion
**Related:** bootstrapping-strategy.md, infometish-bootstrapping-strategy.md, development-runtime-architecture.md

## Effort: M
**Estimate:** Medium complexity requiring understanding of architectural evolution and organizational relationships, with clear structure from recent documentation

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] Mermaid diagram showing seed repo evolution (hello-splectrum â†’ spl0 â†’ spl1 â†’ extraction)
- [ ] Mermaid diagram showing mature organizational structure (SPlectrum, InfoMetish, Carambah, Sesameh)
- [ ] Diagrams clearly show key components and relationships
- [ ] Diagrams are properly formatted and render correctly
- [ ] Bootstrap/extraction process is clearly visualized
- [ ] Cross-app service patterns are represented
- [ ] Development SE extraction path is illustrated
- [ ] InfoMetish multi-target packaging is shown
- [ ] Unified app-module architecture is depicted

## Work Area: architecture-visualization
**Context:** Following comprehensive architecture documentation sessions covering unified app-module architecture, cross-app service patterns, development runtime requirements, and coordinated bootstrapping strategy for both SPlectrum and InfoMetish organizations.

Key architectural insights to visualize:
- **Seed Repo Evolution**: hello-splectrum â†’ spl0 â†’ spl1 â†’ coordinated extraction
- **Unified App Architecture**: Apps and modules using same repository template
- **Cross-App Service Pattern**: Service apps providing development capabilities
- **Development SE**: Preloaded with essential service apps
- **InfoMetish Bootstrap**: Zip wrapper extraction from spl1 plus multi-target expansion
- **Organizational Structure**: Clear separation of concerns across four organizations
- **Component Relationships**: How APIs, apps, compositions, and packaging interact
